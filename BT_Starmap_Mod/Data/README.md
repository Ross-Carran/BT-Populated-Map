BT-Populated-Map

Battletech Mod that populates the map with more systems for the Base factions of the game, based on year 3025 listed by Sarna Unified Cartography Kit, specificaly for use in the Battletech Revised mod.

The mod should work with any other mods (to my knowledge) so long as they do not directly change the X,Y paramaters of the systemdef files for systems.

Special Thanks To JamieWolf of the InnerSphereMap mod, https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/148?tab=description, for giving permission to use data from the mod to help give the systems more life and meaning.

Credit also goes to the people at https://www.sarna.net/ who put in a massive effort of mapping out the entirity of the innisphere and making that data available to everyone, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x9bvFqSb4_or8JbvGj2LnezGkChWxEzRPf5FXvjonHE/edit#gid=763006440.

Without these sources of information this mod for Battletech would not have been possible.
